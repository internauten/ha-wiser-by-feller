Use your Wiser by Feller smart light switches, cover controls and scene buttons in Home Assistant. Note that this is an unofficial integration that is not affiliated with Feller AG. All brand and product names are courtesy of Feller AG.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration implements [Wiser by Feller](https://wiser.feller.ch) and not [Wiser by Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/de/de/product-range/65635-wiser/), which is a competing Smart Home platform (and is not compatible). It es even more confusing, as Feller (the company) is a local subsidiary of Schneider Electric, catering only to the Swiss market.

## 📦 Installation
### Using Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Syonix&repository=ha-wiser-by-feller)

**Click the button above** or perform the following steps:
1. Ensure [HACS is installed](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/).
2. Navigate to HACS on your Home Assistant
3. Search for "Wiser by Feller"
4. Click "Download" in the bottom right corner and follow the instructions.

### Manual installation
Copy the directory `custom_components/wiser_by_feller` into your `custom_components` directory.
If it does not exist yet, you can create it in the home assistant installation directory.

## ⚙️ Setup
> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure your Wiser setup has been fully configured by your electrician before adding it to Home Assistant. Otherwise, naming and categorizing all the devices can be very time-consuming and confusing.

Home Assistant should ✨automagically✨ discover your µGateway and suggest to set it up. If not, you can follow these steps to connect manually:

1. Go to Settings → Devices & services and click **"Add Integration"**.
2. Search for **Wiser by Feller**
3. Enter the **IP address** of your µGateway.\
   ***Important:** If you have multiple home assistant installations or other applications that connect to your µGateway, make sure to use a unique username (e.g. `homeassistant` and `ha-testbench`) for each installation. Connecting with the same username on a second installation leads to the first one being de-authorized.*
4. Fill in the **username** you would like home assistant to claim with the Gateway.
5. The buttons on your µGateway should start **flashing purple and pink**. Press one of them within 30 seconds

> [!TIP]
> When you connect your gateway, all your settings (room and device names, scenes, etc.) are copied over from the user you pick (for a normal install that's either the installer (`installer`, via Wiser eSetup app) or the end user (`admin`, via Wiser Home app).
>
> If you add more scenes with the Wiser eSetup or Wiser Home app, you need to reconnect the user (Note: This is currently under development).

### Configuration
#### Allow missing µGateway data
By default, the setup fails, if fields like `fw_version` or `serial_nr` are missing for devices in the API response. Enable this option for debug purposes to disable the check. See [this Wiser API GitHub issue for more details](https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-api/issues/43).

> [!CAUTION]
> Use with caution, this can affect entity IDs and functionality! You should always check the actual API output manually before checking this checkbox.

## 🗑️ Removal
To remove the integration from Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services**.
2. Find **Wiser by Feller** and click on it.
3. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner and select **Delete**.

This removes all entities, devices, and configuration associated with this integration. Your Wiser setup is not affected — devices continue to work normally through the Wiser app.

If you also installed via HACS and want to remove the files:
1. Open HACS and navigate to **Integrations**.
2. Find **Wiser by Feller**, click the three-dot menu, and select **Remove**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## 🧰 Basic functionality
Wiser by Feller devices always consist of two parts: The control front and the base module. There are switching base modules (for light switches and cover controllers) and non-switching base modules (for scene buttons and secondary controls).

Learn more about Wiser devices on the [official website](https://wiser.feller.ch) and [API documentation](https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-tutorial).

## 🚀 Features
Here's what the integration currently supports:

### ✨ Seamless setup & autodiscovery
After you've installed the integration, Home Assistant will autodetect your µGateway and suggest installing it. Based on your network it might be possible that you have to manually enter its hostname or IP address.

You can also give your installation a unique username and select from which user you want to copy scenes and settings from. Room assignments are automatically suggested on setup, as long as their names match between Home Assistant and Wiser.

### 💡 Devices and Entities
A Wiser device is a physical piece of hardware in your installation, such as a light switch or a cover controller. A load is the thing it controls, e.g. a light, an awning, or a heating valve. A single Wiser device can have one load, two loads, or six loads in the case of the heating controller.

In Home Assistant, each load is represented as its own device. This means a Wiser light switch with two loads will appear as two separate Home Assistant devices.

Some Wiser devices have no loads at all, such as scene buttons or secondary switches ("Nebenstellen"). These are still represented as a single Home Assistant device. They only have the identify entity but are also selectable in the status LED service (see [below](#-status-leds)).

### 🕹️ Identify buttons for devices
You can ping (identify) any device, which makes their button illumination flash for a short amount of time.

### 🌅 Trigger Wiser scenes
Wiser scenes are integrated as native Home Assistant scenes, allowing to trigger them like any other scene as well as use them in automations.

### 🔄 Websocket Updates
The integration listens to state changes via a Websocket, leading to near-instant updates in Home Assistant

### 🚨 Status LEDs
Wiser by Feller devices have customizable status LEDs that can indicate load states or system status. The integration supports two ways to control these LEDs. For detailed information on both methods, including examples and advanced features, see the [LED Control documentation](docs/led-control.md).

### 🎛️ Button Events
Physical button presses fire a Home Assistant event you can use in automations (click, long press, release). For detailed information, see the [Button Events documentation](docs/button-triggers.md).

### 🕹️ System Flag
Already configured system flags appear as switches in Home Assistant. Unfortunately currently there is no way to configure them other than via API. An integrated management of flags is planned (See #20).

### 🧰 Housekeeping
The integration automatically prompts you to re-connect if there is any authentication error.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
Here's a couple of things that are on the roadmap for future releases:
- Wiser system flag management [#20](https://github.com/Syonix/ha-wiser-by-feller/issues/20)

## 🛟 Frequently asked questions
### Setup error `Invalid API response: Device 00012345 has an empty field c.comm_ref!`
This is a known bug in the Wiser µGateway firmware. The integration will now offer to fix the issue with one click (requires µGateway firmware version 6.0.40 or newer).
Refer to issue [#48](https://github.com/Syonix/ha-wiser-by-feller/issues/48) and [Feller-AG/wiser-api#43](https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-api/issues/43) for more in-depth information.

### Setup error `The API returned the error 'no site info'.`
This happens if your Wiser system has not been finalized by an electrician / installer.
This process includes naming all the loads, setting up rooms, assigning loads to rooms, etc.
To resolve this, please ask your electrician / installer to finalize the setup using the [Wiser eSetup app](https://www.feller.ch/de/feller-apps),
or refer to https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-api/issues/49 for more information on using the API to finalize the system.

## ⚠️ Known issues
- As of right now, the µGateway API only supports Rest and Websockets. MQTT is implemented, [but only for the proprietary app](https://github.com/Feller-AG/wiser-api/issues/23).
- While Home Assistant supports updating the state of multiple devices at once, it does not support controlling multiple devices together. Home Assistant scenes will therefore always update one device after another, while Wiser native scenes will update all devices in parallel. For an optimal experience it is therefore recommended to maintain scenes in Wiser and trigger them with Home Assistant.
- By default, a heating controller is exposed to HA as a heating device. If your heating source also supports cooling, HA will dynamically update the supported modes from heating and off to cooling and off. This was decided because unlike a split system, a heating system like this will not be able to quickly switch between heating and cooling, thus the mode heating/cooling is not correct. Switching between modes currently requires you to reload the dashboard.
- The Wiser API allows for custom blink pattern, duration and color for load (e.g. light outputs) pinging. For load-less devices (sensor-only or secondary controls), the API currently only supports pinging by blinking once in yellow.
